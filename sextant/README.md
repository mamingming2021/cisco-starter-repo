# background information on your task

Cisco is developing a network dashboard called Sextant, a locally hosted single-page application meant to assist field technicians in their day-to-day. The project was just greenlit, and everyone’s excited to get started. The requirements are still being finalized, but your team has enough information to bootstrap the project. In this task, you will prepare your local development environment, initialize the project, and brush up on the technologies Sextant needs. Your team has chosen React as Sextant’s frontend framework, so the first step will be to scaffold the project using the excellent create-react-app utility. As it turns out, it’s quite easy to get a website up and running with modern tooling. Many engineers have spent many hours automating the process so you can focus on the content of your site rather than the infrastructure which serves it. So without further adieu, let’s get this show on the road!
